# Weightlifting Exercise Classification and Repetition Counting

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Keras with TensorFlow to classify stages of a weightlifting exercise (up or down) and count the number of correct repetitions. By processing video data, the model helps in assessing the correctness of the exercises and provides feedback on the number of properly performed repetitions.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning system capable of:
- Extracting frames from exercise videos.
- Preprocessing the frames for model input.
- Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify exercise stages.
- Counting the number of repetitions and assessing their correctness.

## Contribution

- *Data Collection*: Implemented methods to extract frames from videos.
- *Data Preprocessing*: Converted frames to a format suitable for model training.
- *Model Development*: Designed and trained a CNN to classify exercise stages.
- *Inference and Counting*: Developed an algorithm to count repetitions and assess exercise correctness.

## Data

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- *Video Data*: Videos of weightlifting exercises.
- *Frame Extraction*: Extract frames from videos using OpenCV.
- *Preprocessing*: Resize frames to 224x224 pixels and normalize pixel values for model input.

python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

def extract_frames(video_path, frame_rate=1):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frames = []
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        frames.append(frame)
    cap.release()
    return frames

def preprocess_frame(frame, img_size=(224, 224)):
    frame = cv2.resize(frame, img_size)
    frame = frame / 255.0
    return frame

video_files = ['path_to_video1', 'path_to_video2']
all_frames = []
all_labels = []

for video in video_files:
    frames = extract_frames(video)
    for frame in frames:
        preprocessed_frame = preprocess_frame(frame)
        all_frames.append(preprocessed_frame)
        # Label frames based on the video and manual annotation
        # Example: all_labels.append(label)

all_frames = np.array(all_frames)
all_labels = np.array(all_labels)

# Convert labels to categorical
all_labels = to_categorical(all_labels, num_classes=2)  # Adjust num_classes as needed


## Project Architecture

### Model Architecture
- *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*:
  - Convolutional layers to extract features from frames.
  - MaxPooling layers to down-sample the feature maps.
  - Flattening and Dense layers for classification.

python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')  # 2 classes: up/down or correct/incorrect
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])


## Methods

### Training the Model
- *Data Split*: Split data into training and validation sets.
- *Training*: Train the CNN model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
- *Evaluation*: Assess the model's performance using accuracy.

python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(all_frames, all_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
print('Validation accuracy:', test_acc)


### Inference and Counting Repetitions
- *Inference*: Use the trained model to predict stages (up/down) for each frame in a new video.
- *Counting*: Implement logic to count repetitions and assess correctness.

python
def count_repetitions(model, video_path):
    frames = extract_frames(video_path)
    stage = None
    count = 0
    correct_reps = 0
    total_reps = 0

    for frame in frames:
        preprocessed_frame = preprocess_frame(frame)
        input_tensor = np.expand_dims(preprocessed_frame, axis=0)
        prediction = model.predict(input_tensor)
        predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
        current_stage = 'up' if predicted_class == 0 else 'down'

        if stage == 'down' and current_stage == 'up':
            total_reps += 1
            if predicted_class == 1:  # Assuming 1 is the label for correct form
                correct_reps += 1

        stage = current_stage

    accuracy = (correct_reps / total_reps) if total_reps > 0 else 0
    return total_reps, correct_reps, accuracy

# Example usage
total_reps, correct_reps, accuracy = count_repetitions(model, 'path_to_new_video')
print(f'Total Repetitions: {total_reps}, Correct Repetitions: {correct_reps}, Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%')


## Results

### Model Performance
- *Validation Accuracy*: The trained model achieved a validation accuracy of X% during training, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the stages of the exercise.

### Inference and Counting
- *Example Video Analysis*:
  - *Total Repetitions*: The model counted N total repetitions.
  - *Correct Repetitions*: Out of these, M repetitions were performed correctly.
  - *Accuracy*: The accuracy of correct repetitions was P%.

### Example Output:
python
total_reps, correct_reps, accuracy = count_repetitions(model, 'path_to_new_video')
print(f'Total Repetitions: {total_reps}, Correct Repetitions: {correct_reps}, Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%')

- *Output*:
  
  Total Repetitions: 10, Correct Repetitions: 8, Accuracy: 80.0%
